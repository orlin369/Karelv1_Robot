The `Zend\Memory` component is intended to manage data in an environment with
limited memory.

Memory objects (memory containers) are generated by memory manager by request
and transparently swapped/loaded when itâ€™s necessary.

For example, if creating or loading a managed object would cause the total memory
usage to exceed the limit you specify, some managed objects are copied to cache
storage outside of memory. In this way, the total memory used by managed objects
does not exceed the limit you need to enforce.
