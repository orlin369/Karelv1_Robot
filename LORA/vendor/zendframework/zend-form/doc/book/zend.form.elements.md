# Form Elements

## Introduction

A set of specialized elements are provided for accomplishing application-centric tasks. These
include several HTML5 input elements with matching server-side validators, the `Csrf` element (to
prevent Cross Site Request Forgery attacks), and the `Captcha` element (to display and validate
\[CAPTCHAs\](zend.captcha)).

A `Factory` is provided to facilitate creation of elements, fieldsets, forms, and the related input
filter. See the \[Zend\\Form Quick Start\](zend.form.quick-start.factory) for more information.
