=======================

Introduction
------------
This is a simple aplication for Adrduino Uno board.
Application control the motors and read the sensors in the robot.
The connection between Host and the robot is via UART.
The protocol is custum and it is based on ASCII, so the user can easily control/test
the robot in simple serial terminal.
The robot are build to help young roboticist to learn how to program:
embedded systems, use peripheral modules, sensor processing and motor contrl.

### What we are using

`Arduino Uno` - Official Arduino Uno page. - https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/arduinoBoardUno
`ATMega328P-20PU` - The chip. - http://www.atmel.com/images/Atmel-8271-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega48A-48PA-88A-88PA-168A-168PA-328-328P_datasheet_Complete.pdf
`Visual Studio / Arduino` - We use Visual Studio for the project and Visual micro plugin - http://www.visualmicro.com/

### HowToBasic

Arduino is easy to use opensource platform that can bring alot of knolage.
This makes it perfect for the purpose of education.

Main idea behind this project is to control the robot mechatronics.
